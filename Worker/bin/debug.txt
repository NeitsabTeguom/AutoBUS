From my experience, you can try VS Code + CodeLLDB plugin, which generally works well for me.
The steps are as follows:

1 Add --debug option to valac.
    This can be done with "add_project_arguments" in meson.build

2 Generate a launch.json for LLDB.
    This can be done with "create a launch.json file" in "Run and Debug" of VS Code.

3 It will create a .vscode directory and a launch.json file inside it.
    Ensure that you have installed CodeLLDB plugin. Modity the "configurations" in the launch.json, such that "configurations" in the file becomes (<my program> needs to be changed to your executable file name)

    "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Launch",
                "type": "lldb",
                "request": "launch",
                "program": "${workspaceFolder}/<my program>",
                "args": ["-arg1", "-arg2"],
            }
        ]

4 Then you can set breakpoints and start debugging in VS Code.
